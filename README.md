# TMLR BibLaTeX proposal

This repository contains proposed LaTeX code to be added to the TMLR style file, which switches it from `natbib` to the much newer `biblatex` reference management system. 
It also contains a test document which can be compiled to check behavior of edge cases, such as for instance when the same author has multiple papers of the same year.

A compiled version of the test document is available at **TODO: set up GitHub CI**.
